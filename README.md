# Project-Oop
University Project

## hotel management software
This project was done with the intention of improving the mini-hotel of a family member.

## what did I learn?

-I understood in a basic way how to use the objects to create **big projects**.
-I learned how to use **design patterns**.

## how to run the code?
You just have to run the file called mainly.py. however you should have all the other files in one folder (you don't need to run them too)
